# R Notebook
Luke Telfer  
BIOL 601  

The R notebook is intended to be a collection of R programming that you wrote.  This will be useful later in life when you need a reference about R that makes sense (since you made the notebook hopefully you understand it).  After each homework has been ‘corrected’, you should place your homework in a notebookthat is organized and can easily be referenced this semester (and for life).  A well organized notebook will be one the keys to your continued success in statistics.

To be useful the notebook should be thorough, neat, and well organized.  You may also include items that are not R homework per se, such as a table of contents, notes on conducting research, useful papers, etc.More details to come.
